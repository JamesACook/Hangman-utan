The classic Hangman game with hyphenated answers included = beast mode!
Monkey theme but nothing to do with Hartlepool.

## How to Play:

1. Click on ‘Start New Game’ to begin.
2. Start guessing the word by clicking on a letter at a time.
3. You have 10 chances to guess the right word.
4. Number of blank spaces indicates letters in the word.
5. If your guess is correct, the letter is revealed.
6. If your guess is incorrect, you lose a chance.
7. You win when you get every letter of the word before hangman drawing finishes.

## Installation Instructions

If the game is not hosted in GitHub already with a link you can install on your machine.
We recommend free program Visual Studio Code to achieve this.

Create a new folder then in the terminal (or a new terminal if required) :

### Update NPM:

`npm install -g npm@latest`

### Update Node:

`npm install -g node@latest`

### Install React App

### Clone this repository

Why not download the zip file from GitHub and paste the contents of the folder 
into the new one. First delete the existing.

`npm install --save @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`
